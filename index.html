<div class="explain">The above given division's width is 50% of the device width and has a top and bottom margin of 20px and left and right margin
of 30px. It also assigned with a border of 1px solid green and has padding 20% of the size of the division.
<p>
  The image is actually much larger than the device. But we here given a specified box-size property as border-box so that the image will not exceeds the division size.\

</p>
<p>
  The overflow "Scroll" is given to the division so that it can accomodate so many data without exceeding the division size. Even the current
  division also uses the scroll because it only has a specified hieght of 100px.
